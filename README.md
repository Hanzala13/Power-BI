# Power-BI
Power BI is a Microsoft-powered business intelligence tool that helps transform raw data into interactive dashboards and actionable insights. It allow users to connect to various data sources, clean and shape data and visualize it using charts, graphs and reports all with minimal coding.

## What is Power BI Used For?
Power BI is a tool that helps you understand your data better. you can:

Bring in data from different places like Excel files, SQL databases, CSVs, JSON files and even websites.

Clean and fix your data easily without writing code.

Create visuals like bar charts, line graphs, pie charts and dashboards to help you see patterns and trends.

Analyze your data using filters and slicers, so you can focus on specific details like sales by region or product performance over time.

Share your dashboards with your team or clients so everyone stays informed and can explore the data on their own.

Set up automatic updates so your reports always show the latest information without you having to do anything.

## What is Business Intelligence?

Business Intelligence is the talk of a new changing and growing world that can be defined as a set of concepts and methodologies to improve decision-making in business through the use of facts and fact-based systems. The Goal of Business Intelligence is to improve decision-making in business ideas and analysis. Business Intelligence is not just a concept; itâ€™s a group of concepts and methodologies. Business Intelligence uses analytics and gut feelings for making decisions.

Business Intelligence Overview
Business intelligence refers to a collection of mathematical models and analysis methods that utilize data to produce valuable information and insight for making important decisions.

## Main Components of Business Intelligence System:

### Data Source
### Data Mart / Data Warehouse
### Data Exploration
### Data Mining
### Optimization
### Decisions

1. Data Source
The first step is gathering and consolidating data from an array of primary and secondary sources. These sources vary in origin and format, consisting mainly of operational system data but also potentially containing unstructured documents like emails and data from external providers.

2. Data Mart / Data Warehouse
Through the utilization of extraction and transformation tools, also known as extract, transform, load (ETL), data is acquired from various sources and saved in databases designed specifically for business intelligence analysis. These databases, commonly known as data warehouses and data marts, serve as a centralized location for the gathered data.

3.Data Exploration
The third level of the pyramid offers essential resources for conducting a passive analysis in business intelligence. These resources include query and reporting systems, along with statistical methods. These techniques are referred to as passive because decision makers must first develop ideas or establish criteria for data extraction before utilizing analysis tools to uncover answers and confirm their initial theories. For example, a sales manager might observe a decrease in revenues in a particular geographic region for a specific demographic of customers. In response, she could utilize extraction and visualization tools to confirm her hypothesis and then use statistical testing to validate her findings based on the data.

4.Data Mining
The fourth level, known as active business intelligence methodologies, focuses on extracting valuable information and knowledge from data. We will delve into various techniques such as mathematical models, pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. Unlike the tools discussed in the previous level, active models do not rely on decision makers to come up with hypothesis but instead aim to enhance their understanding.

5.Optimization
As you ascend the pyramid, you'll encounter optimization models that empower you to choose the most optimal course of action among various alternatives, which can often be quite extensive or even endless. These models have also been effectively incorporated in marketing and logistics.

## Role of Business Intelligence
The characteristics of a business intelligence analysis can be summarized by a rational and methodical approach.

Firstly, the objectives are clearly identified and performance indicators are chosen to evaluate different options.
Next, mathematical models are created by utilizing the connections between control variables, parameters, and evaluation metrics.
Finally, "what-if" scenarios are explored to understand the impact of changing control variables and parameters on performance.
