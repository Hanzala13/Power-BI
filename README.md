## What is Business Intelligence?

Business Intelligence is the talk of a new changing and growing world that can be defined as a set of concepts and methodologies to improve decision-making in business through the use of facts and fact-based systems. The Goal of Business Intelligence is to improve decision-making in business ideas and analysis. Business Intelligence is not just a concept; it’s a group of concepts and methodologies. Business Intelligence uses analytics and gut feelings for making decisions.

Business Intelligence Overview
Business intelligence refers to a collection of mathematical models and analysis methods that utilize data to produce valuable information and insight for making important decisions.

## Main Components of Business Intelligence System:

### Data Source
### Data Mart / Data Warehouse
### Data Exploration
### Data Mining
### Optimization
### Decisions

1. Data Source
The first step is gathering and consolidating data from an array of primary and secondary sources. These sources vary in origin and format, consisting mainly of operational system data but also potentially containing unstructured documents like emails and data from external providers.

2. Data Mart / Data Warehouse
Through the utilization of extraction and transformation tools, also known as extract, transform, load (ETL), data is acquired from various sources and saved in databases designed specifically for business intelligence analysis. These databases, commonly known as data warehouses and data marts, serve as a centralized location for the gathered data.

3.Data Exploration
The third level of the pyramid offers essential resources for conducting a passive analysis in business intelligence. These resources include query and reporting systems, along with statistical methods. These techniques are referred to as passive because decision makers must first develop ideas or establish criteria for data extraction before utilizing analysis tools to uncover answers and confirm their initial theories. For example, a sales manager might observe a decrease in revenues in a particular geographic region for a specific demographic of customers. In response, she could utilize extraction and visualization tools to confirm her hypothesis and then use statistical testing to validate her findings based on the data.

4.Data Mining
The fourth level, known as active business intelligence methodologies, focuses on extracting valuable information and knowledge from data. We will delve into various techniques such as mathematical models, pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. Unlike the tools discussed in the previous level, active models do not rely on decision makers to come up with hypothesis but instead aim to enhance their understanding.

5.Optimization
As you ascend the pyramid, you'll encounter optimization models that empower you to choose the most optimal course of action among various alternatives, which can often be quite extensive or even endless. These models have also been effectively incorporated in marketing and logistics.

## Role of Business Intelligence
The characteristics of a business intelligence analysis can be summarized by a rational and methodical approach.

Firstly, the objectives are clearly identified and performance indicators are chosen to evaluate different options.
Next, mathematical models are created by utilizing the connections between control variables, parameters, and evaluation metrics.
Finally, "what-if" scenarios are explored to understand the impact of changing control variables and parameters on performance.

## Process Used in Business Intelligence
BI (Business Intelligence) uses a set of processes, technologies, and tools (such as Informatica/IBM) to transform raw data into meaningful information and then transform information to provide knowledge. Then afterwards some beneficial insights can be extracted manually and by some software then the decision-makers can make an impact decision on the basis of insights.

To sound short and clear – Business Intelligence provides accurate information in the right and ethical format to the decision-makers of the organization. Some Important features of Business Intelligence are:

Fact-based decision making.
360 degrees perspective on your business.
Measurement for creating KPI (Key Performance Indicators) on the basis of historic data fed into the system.
Identify the benchmark and then set the benchmarks for different processes.
Identify market trends and also to spot business problems that need to be identified and solved.

## Tips for Using Power BI Effectively
Learn DAX for Advanced Calculations: DAX is a formula language that can help you perform advanced calculations. If you want to create more complex analytics learning DAX is a good idea.
Master Power Query: Power Query helps you to prepare your data. The more you learn about it the more efficient your workflow will be.
Stay Organized: When you create more reports it's important to keep things organized by giving fields, calculations clear and descriptive names.
Explore Templates: It has many templates for different industries. Use them to get started quickly and spark new ideas for your own reports.

## 1. Power Query
Power Query is the first step in working with data in Power BI. It allows you to connect to different data sources like Excel files, databases, web pages or even cloud-based services. Once the data is imported Power Query helps you to clean, transform and shape it into a useful format.
We can remove unnecessary rows, change column names, combine data from multiple tables and much more all without programming using Power BI. This process is called “data wrangling" and Power Query makes it easy and visual.

2. Power View
Power View helps us to create visuals and reports by simply dragging and dropping data fields. It support wide range of chart types like bar charts, pie charts, line charts, maps and more.
It’s interactive which means you can click on parts of the chart to filter other parts of the report. It is mainly used to explore your data visually and discover trends. It is helpful for users who prefer to see patterns through visuals rather than numbers.

3. Power BI Desktop
Power BI Desktop is the main platform where most of the work happens. It combines all the features like Power Query (for cleaning data), Power Pivot (for modeling data) and Power View (for visualizing data) into one tool. This is where you build complete reports and dashboards.
This interface is user-friendly and it allows you to design everything offline before publishing it online. It is like workshop were we prepare everything here before sharing it with our team or organization.

5. Power BI Service
After we create our reports in Power BI Desktop you can publish them to the Power BI Service which is also known as the Power BI Website. Here we can share your reports with others, collaborate in teams and access your data from any device using a browser.
It’s a cloud-based platform that also lets us schedule data refreshes and receive automatic updates. We can also create dashboards here by pinning visuals from different reports into one view for easy monitoring.
